# Platform monetization model update

Business context: The specialized ed-tech platform N, designed for preparing candidates for analyst interviews and for practicing programming skills (users solve problems and take tests), has set itself the goal of changing its monetization model. 
Currently, monetization is implemented through an internal currency called CodeCoins. Users earn coins through activity on the platformâ€”for example, by solving problems or passing tests - and spend them on locked tasks and other premium materials. If users do not have enough coins, they can purchase them with real money. This system works well for gamification (users enjoy earning coins, spending them, and then earning more), but it has several significant drawbacks:

1) Low marketability - the internal currency receives virtually no advertising or promotional support;
2) Limited promotional flexibility - difficult to design and run effective campaigns using the currency;
3) Low transaction value - most purchases are for small, inexpensive coin packs.
4) Low purchase frequency - users can buy coins once and have them last for an extended period.
